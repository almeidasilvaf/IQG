The goal here is to provide students with a more modern and real-life approach to quantitative genetics, without pens, paper and calculators.

M MN N 1787 3039 1303 (1) What are the genotype frequencies observed in this sample? MM &lt;- 1787 MN &lt;- 3039 NN &lt;- 1303 n &lt;- MM + MN + NN # Genotype frequencies P &lt;- MM / n P ## [1] 0.2915647 H &lt;- MN / n H ## [1] 0.4958395 Q &lt;- NN / n Q ## [1] 0.2125959 What are the gene frequencies? Given that: \\[p = P + \\frac{1}{2}H\\] and \\[q = Q + \\frac{1}{2}H\\] We get to: # Gene frequencies p &lt;- P + H/2 p ## [1] 0.5394844 q &lt;- Q + H/2 With the gene frequencies observed, what are the genotype frequencies expected from the Hardy-Weinberg law? Expected frequencies in the equilibrium: \\[p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\\] expected &lt;- c(MM = p^2, MN = 2*p*q, NN = q^2) expected ## MM MN NN ## 0.2910434 0.4968820 0.2120746 How well do the observed frequencies agree with the expectation? Data from Wiener, A.S. (1943) quoted by Stem, C. (1973) Principles of Human Genetics. Freeman, San Francisco. We can measure how well the observed frequencies agree with the expected ones with a Chi-squared test: # Summarizing what we have exp_obs &lt;- data.frame( `Expected freq` = expected, `Observed freq` = c(P, H, Q)) exp_obs ## Expected.freq Observed.freq ## MM 0.2910434 0.2915647 ## MN 0.4968820 0.4958395 ## NN 0.2120746 0.2125959 # Applying Chi-squared test observed &lt;- c(MM = 1787, MN = 3039, NN = 1303) HardyWeinberg::HWChisq(observed, verbose=TRUE) ## Chi-square test with continuity correction for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (autosomal) ## Chi2 = 0.02104769 DF = 1 p-value = 0.8846491 D = -3.194771 f = 0.002098103 The \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is very close to 0, with P &gt; 0.05. Then, we conclude that the observed and expected frequencies are not different. 1.2 Problem 2 About 30 per cent of people do not recognize the bitter taste of phenyl-thio-carbamate (PTC). Inability to taste it is due to a single autosomal recessive gene. What is the frequency of the non-tasting gene, assuming the population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? If the trait is caused by two recessive alleles (aa), then the frequency of aa will be equal to \\(q^2\\). As \\(q^2 = 0.3\\), \\(q = \\sqrt{0.3} = 0.548\\). 1.3 Problem 3 Albinism occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 20,000 in European populations. Assuming it to be due to a single autosomal recessive gene, and assuming the population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what proportion of people are carriers? Only an approximate answer is needed. Carriers are heterozigote individuals, i.e., 2pq. From \\(q^2\\), we can calculate p and, hence, 2pq as follows: q2 &lt;- 1/20000 q &lt;- sqrt(q2) p &lt;- 1 - q heterozygotes &lt;- 2*p*q heterozygotes ## [1] 0.01404214 1.4 Problem 4 As an exercise in algebra, work out the gene frequency of a recessive mutant in a random-breeding population that would result in one-third of normal individuals being carriers. 1/3 of the normal individuals as carriers means: \\[ \\frac{2pq}{1-q^2} = \\frac{2q(1-q)}{1-q^2} = \\frac{2q(1-q)}{(1+q)(1-q)} = \\frac{2q}{1+q} \\] 1.5 Problem 5 Three allelic variants, A, B, and C, of the red cell acid phosphatase enzyme were found in a sample of 178 English people. All genotypes were distinguishable by electrophoresis, and the frequencies in the sample were Genotype AA AB BB AC BC CC Freq (%) 9.6 48.3 34.3 2.8 5.0 0.0 What are the gene frequencies in the sample? Why were no CC individuals found? As the frequency of a gene is equal to the frequency of homozygotes + 1/2 the frequency of heterozygotes, we have: \\[A = 0.096 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.483 + 0.028) = 0.3515\\] \\[B = 0.343 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.483 + 0.05) = 0.6095\\] \\[C = 0.0 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.028 + 0.05) = 0.039\\] The expected frequency of CC individuals is \\(C^2 = 0.039^2 = 0.0015\\). As we have a sample size of 178 individuals, we would expect \\(178 * 0.0015 = 0.27\\) CC individuals (less than 1). Thus, the observed frequency (zero) is expected. We would be able to observe CC individuals if the sample size was larger. "]]
