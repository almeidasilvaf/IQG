The goal here is to provide students with a more modern and real-life approach to quantitative genetics, without pens, paper and calculators. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Genetic constitution of a population 2.1 Problem 1", " Chapter 2 Genetic constitution of a population 2.1 Problem 1 The following numbers of the human M-N blood groups were recorded in a sample of American Whites. M MN N 1787 3039 1303 (1) What are the genotype frequencies observed in this sample? MM &lt;- 1787 MN &lt;- 3039 NN &lt;- 1303 n &lt;- MM + MN + NN # Genotype frequencies P &lt;- MM / n P ## [1] 0.2915647 H &lt;- MN / n H ## [1] 0.4958395 Q &lt;- NN / n Q ## [1] 0.2125959 What are the gene frequencies? Given that: \\[p = P + \\frac{1}{2}H\\] and \\[q = Q + \\frac{1}{2}H\\] We get to: # Gene frequencies p &lt;- P + H/2 p ## [1] 0.5394844 q &lt;- Q + H/2 With the gene frequencies observed, what are the genotype frequencies expected from the Hardy-Weinberg law? Expected frequencies in the equilibrium: \\[p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\\] expected &lt;- c(MM = p^2, MN = 2*p*q, NN = q^2) expected ## MM MN NN ## 0.2910434 0.4968820 0.2120746 How well do the observed frequencies agree with the expectation? Data from Wiener, A.S. (1943) quoted by Stem, C. (1973) Principles of Human Genetics. Freeman, San Francisco. We can measure how well the observed frequencies agree with the expected ones with a Chi-squared test: # Summarizing what we have exp_obs &lt;- data.frame( `Expected freq` = expected, `Observed freq` = c(P, H, Q)) exp_obs ## Expected.freq Observed.freq ## MM 0.2910434 0.2915647 ## MN 0.4968820 0.4958395 ## NN 0.2120746 0.2125959 # Applying Chi-squared test observed &lt;- c(MM = 1787, MN = 3039, NN = 1303) HardyWeinberg::HWChisq(observed, verbose=TRUE) ## Chi-square test with continuity correction for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (autosomal) ## Chi2 = 0.02104769 DF = 1 p-value = 0.8846491 D = -3.194771 f = 0.002098103 The \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is very close to 0, with P &gt; 0.05. Then, we conclude that the observed and expected frequencies are not different. "]]
