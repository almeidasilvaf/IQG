M MN N 1787 3039 1303 (1) What are the genotype frequencies observed in this sample? MM &lt;- 1787 MN &lt;- 3039 NN &lt;- 1303 n &lt;- MM + MN + NN # Genotype frequencies P &lt;- MM / n P ## [1] 0.2915647 H &lt;- MN / n H ## [1] 0.4958395 Q &lt;- NN / n Q ## [1] 0.2125959 What are the gene frequencies? Given that: \\[p = P + \\frac{1}{2}H\\] and \\[q = Q + \\frac{1}{2}H\\] We get to: # Gene frequencies p &lt;- P + H/2 p ## [1] 0.5394844 q &lt;- Q + H/2 With the gene frequencies observed, what are the genotype frequencies expected from the Hardy-Weinberg law? Expected frequencies in the equilibrium: \\[p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\\] expected &lt;- c(MM = p^2, MN = 2*p*q, NN = q^2) expected ## MM MN NN ## 0.2910434 0.4968820 0.2120746 How well do the observed frequencies agree with the expectation? Data from Wiener, A.S. (1943) quoted by Stem, C. (1973) Principles of Human Genetics. Freeman, San Francisco. We can measure how well the observed frequencies agree with the expected ones with a Chi-squared test: # Summarizing what we have exp_obs &lt;- data.frame( `Expected freq` = expected, `Observed freq` = c(P, H, Q)) exp_obs ## Expected.freq Observed.freq ## MM 0.2910434 0.2915647 ## MN 0.4968820 0.4958395 ## NN 0.2120746 0.2125959 # Applying Chi-squared test observed &lt;- c(MM = 1787, MN = 3039, NN = 1303) HardyWeinberg::HWChisq(observed, verbose=TRUE) ## Chi-square test with continuity correction for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (autosomal) ## Chi2 = 0.02104769 DF = 1 p-value = 0.8846491 D = -3.194771 f = 0.002098103 The \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is very close to 0, with P &gt; 0.05. Then, we conclude that the observed and expected frequencies are not different. 1.2 Problem 2 About 30 per cent of people do not recognize the bitter taste of phenyl-thio-carbamate (PTC). Inability to taste it is due to a single autosomal recessive gene. What is the frequency of the non-tasting gene, assuming the population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? If the trait is caused by two recessive alleles (aa), then the frequency of aa will be equal to \\(q^2\\). As \\(q^2 = 0.3\\), \\(q = \\sqrt{0.3} = 0.548\\). 1.3 Problem 3 Albinism occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 20,000 in European populations. Assuming it to be due to a single autosomal recessive gene, and assuming the population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what proportion of people are carriers? Only an approximate answer is needed. Carriers are heterozigote individuals, i.e., 2pq. From \\(q^2\\), we can calculate p and, hence, 2pq as follows: q2 &lt;- 1/20000 q &lt;- sqrt(q2) p &lt;- 1 - q heterozygotes &lt;- 2*p*q heterozygotes ## [1] 0.01404214 1.4 Problem 4 As an exercise in algebra, work out the gene frequency of a recessive mutant in a random-breeding population that would result in one-third of normal individuals being carriers. 1/3 of the normal individuals as carriers means: \\[ \\frac{2pq}{1-q^2} = \\frac{2q(1-q)}{1-q^2} = \\frac{2q(1-q)}{(1+q)(1-q)} = \\frac{2q}{1+q} \\] 1.5 Problem 5 Three allelic variants, A, B, and C, of the red cell acid phosphatase enzyme were found in a sample of 178 English people. All genotypes were distinguishable by electrophoresis, and the frequencies in the sample were Genotype AA AB BB AC BC CC Freq (%) 9.6 48.3 34.3 2.8 5.0 0.0 What are the gene frequencies in the sample? Why were no CC individuals found? As the frequency of a gene is equal to the frequency of homozygotes + 1/2 the frequency of heterozygotes, we have: \\[A = 0.096 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.483 + 0.028) = 0.3515\\] \\[B = 0.343 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.483 + 0.05) = 0.6095\\] \\[C = 0.0 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.028 + 0.05) = 0.039\\] The expected frequency of CC individuals is \\(C^2 = 0.039^2 = 0.0015\\). As we have a sample size of 178 individuals, we would expect \\(178 * 0.0015 = 0.27\\) CC individuals (less than 1). Thus, the observed frequency (zero) is expected. We would be able to observe CC individuals if the sample size was larger. 1.6 Problem 6 About 7 per cent of men are colour-blind in consequence of a sex-linked recessive gene. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what proportion of women are expected to be (1) carriers, and (2) colour-blind? (3) In what proportion of marriages are both husband and wife expected to be colour-blind? 7% of men are color-blind, which means that \\(q = 0.07\\). Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency in men is equal to the frequency in women. Then: \\[Carriers = 2pq = 2q(1-q)\\] # Carriers q &lt;- 0.07 carriers &lt;- 2*q*(1-q) carriers ## [1] 0.1302 Color-blind = \\(q^2 = 0.0049\\). To find the frequency of marriages with both men and women color-blind, we simply multiply the frequency of color-blind men and the frequency of color-blind women. That is: \\[P(men) \\times P(women) = 0.07 \\times 0.0049 = 0.000343\\] 1.7 Problem 7 Sine oculis (so) and cinnabar (cn) are two autosomal recessive genes in Drosophila melanogaster. They are very closely linked and can be treated as if they were alleles at one locus. The ‘heterozygote,’ so/cn, is wild-type and is distinguishable from both homozygotes; (so/so has no eyes; cn/cn has white eyes if the stock is made homozygous for another eye-colour mutant, brown, hw). In a class experiment 4 males and 4 females of an so/so stock were put in a vial together with 16 males and 16 females from a cn/cn stock and allowed to mate. There were 20 such vials. The total count of progeny, classified by genotype, was as follows. so/so so/cn cn/cn 135 359 947 How do these numbers differ from the Hardy-Weinberg expectations? Suggest a reason for the discrepancy. To compare the observed frequencies to the expected under HW equilibrium, we can perform a \\(\\chi^2\\) test. obs_freq &lt;- c(SS = 135, SC = 359, CC = 947) HardyWeinberg::HWChisq(obs_freq, verbose=TRUE) ## Chi-square test with continuity correction for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (autosomal) ## Chi2 = 103.671 DF = 1 p-value = 2.388595e-24 D = -66.35999 f = 0.2699097 We can see, the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is very high, and so is the linkage disequilibrium coefficient (D = -66.35). A possible reason for this is assortative mating. 1.8 Problem 8 Suppose that Drosophila cultures are set up in vials as described in Problem 1.7, but this time with a gene frequency of 0.5. This is done by putting 10 males and 10 females of each stock in each vial. The supply of so/so females ran out and only 4 were left for the last vial. So, to preserve the intended gene frequency and numbers of parents, this vial was made up as follows: 16 males + 4 females of so/so with 4 males + 16 females of cn/cn. The student who got this vial was a bit surprised by what he found. What genotype frequencies would you expect in the progeny? We would not expect HW equilibrium, as the gene frequencies are different between males and females. \\[so_{males} = \\frac{16}{20} = 0.8\\] \\[so_{females} = \\frac{4}{20} = 0.2\\] Obtaining genotype frequencies from the gene frequencies: soso &lt;- 0.8 * 0.2 soso ## [1] 0.16 cncn &lt;- 0.2 * 0.8 cncn ## [1] 0.16 socn &lt;- 1 - (soso + cncn) socn ## [1] 0.68 Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we would expect genotype frequencies to be 0.25, 0.5, 0.25. 1.9 Problem 9 Prove that when there are any number of alleles at a locus the total frequency of heterozygotes is greatest when all alleles have the same frequency. What is then the total frequency of heterozygotes? This can be demonstrated by simulating two alelles with increasingly similar frequencies and calculating the frequency of heterozygotes for each simulation step. # Define function to calculate heterozygote frequency heterozygote_freq &lt;- function(p, q) { heterozygotes &lt;- 2*p*q return(heterozygotes) } # Create vectors of frequencies for p and q psim &lt;- seq(0.01, 0.5, length.out = 50) qsim &lt;- seq(0.99, 0.5, length.out = 50) # Calculate heterozygote frequency for simulated p and q freqs hfreq &lt;- lapply(seq_along(psim), function(x) { freq &lt;- heterozygote_freq(p = psim[x], q = qsim[x]) distance &lt;- abs(psim[x] - qsim[x]) df &lt;- data.frame( `Hfreq` = freq, `Diff` = distance ) return(df) }) hfreq &lt;- Reduce(rbind, hfreq) # Inspecting visually suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2)) ggplot(hfreq, aes(y = Hfreq, x = Diff, group=1)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + theme_classic() + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.5, 0.1)) + labs(x = &quot;Allele frequency difference&quot;, y = &quot;Relative frequency of heterozygotes&quot;, title = &quot;Frequency of heterozygotes as a function of allele frequency differences&quot;, subtitle = &quot;The frequency of heterozygotes reaches its maximum when p and q have equal frequencies&quot;) 1.10 Problem 10 Suppose that a strain of genotype AA BB is mixed with another strain of genotype aa bb, with equal numbers of the two strains and equal numbers of males and females, which mate at random. Call this generation of parents generation 0. Subsequent generations also mate at random and there are no differences of fertility or viability among the genotypes. What will be the frequency of the genotype AA bb in the progeny of generation 2, i.e. after two generations of recombination, if the two loci are (1) unlinked, (2) linked with a recombination frequency of 20 per cent? 1.11 Problem 11 How will the solutions of Problem 1.10 be altered if the two strains are crossed by taking males of one strain and females of the other?
